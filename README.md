# Dancing Android Logo

This was a class assignment on HTML and CSS for The Odin Project online web development bootcamp. The original code I worked on in class has also been modified to include additional moving appendages, the legs.

## Getting Started

1. Download repository
2. Open index.html in your browser of choice
3. Play around with the head, arms, and legs of the little green Android logo monster
4. Think about how much better you are now that you have this in your life
